# CS Fundamentals

This repository contains concise, interview-oriented explanations of core computer science fundamentals
that I use in my backend projects.

The focus is on understanding and explainability, not exhaustive theory or notes.

Each topic is written in simple language and connected to real-world backend usage
(from projects like PromptPulse).

Topics covered:
- Operating Systems
- DBMS
- Computer Networks
- OOPS
